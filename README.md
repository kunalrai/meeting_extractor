### README: Video OCR Text Extractor

#### Overview
This Python script extracts text from video frames using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with the `pytesseract` library. It is designed to process a video file and extract text from specified intervals, storing the extracted text along with its timestamp.

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR
- Python libraries: `PIL`, `pytesseract`, `moviepy`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`

#### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python 3.x:**
   - Download and install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Tesseract OCR:**
   - Download and install Tesseract OCR from [this link](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   - Note: During installation, ensure Tesseract is added to the system's PATH.

3. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install Pillow pytesseract moviepy numpy opencv-python
     ```

#### Running the Script

1. **Set Tesseract Command:**
   - Modify the script to set the `tesseract_cmd` to the path where Tesseract OCR is installed:
     ```python
     pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
     ```

2. **Specify the Video Path:**
   - Place the video file in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the video file in the script:
     ```python
     video_path = 'path_to_your_video.mp4'
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script in the terminal or command prompt:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```

4. **Extract Text:**
   - The script will process the video and output the extracted texts along with their timestamps. Adjust the start and end times in the script to specify different segments of the video.

#### Notes
- The script currently processes a specific interval of the video. Modify the start and end times in the function call to process different parts of the video.
- The extraction accuracy depends on the quality of the video and the clarity of the text in the frames.
